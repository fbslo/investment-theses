<h3>Investment Warnings</h3> 

We would like to draw your attention to the following important investment warnings.

-   The value of investments and the income derived from them can go down as well as up.
-   Investors may not get back the amount they invested - losing one's shirt is a real risk.
-   Past performance is not a guide to future performance.
